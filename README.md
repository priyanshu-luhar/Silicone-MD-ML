## Introduction

Silicone-MD-ML is a modular Python framework for generating large ensembles of atomistic silicon slab structures with controlled chemical doping and point defects. The primary goal of this project is to support high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the construction of statistically meaningful datasets for data-driven and machine-learning-based materials modeling.

The framework emphasizes reproducibility, physical interpretability, and scalability. All stochastic operations are explicitly controlled, allowing deterministic regeneration of identical structures across different runs and systems.

## Structures Class

The `Structures` class is responsible for handling pristine silicon slabs and generating substitutionally doped variants.

### Purpose

- Load and validate XYZ-formatted atomic structures
- Perform uniform random substitutional doping
- Track structure identities across large generation campaigns
- Output doped structures in XYZ format with descriptive metadata

### Doping Model

Substitutional doping is implemented by uniformly sampling silicon atoms and replacing their atomic species with a specified dopant element. Atomic coordinates remain unchanged, ensuring that only chemical identity is modified. The number of substitutions is determined by the requested dopant concentration.

Both fractional (e.g., `0.001`) and percentage (e.g., `0.1`) concentrations are supported. Random sampling can be seeded to guarantee reproducibility.

### Design Features

- Uniform random selection without replacement
- Deterministic behavior through explicit seeding
- Automatic structure ID incrementation
- Clean separation between structure loading and modification logic

---

## Defects Class

The `Defects` class introduces point defects into previously generated (pristine or doped) structures.

### Purpose

- Apply physically motivated point defects to atomistic structures
- Support both vacancy-based and displacement-based defect models
- Maintain reproducibility and uniform defect distributions

---

### Schottky Defects

Schottky defects are modeled as vacancies created by removing atoms from their lattice sites.

**Implementation details:**
- Atoms are removed uniformly at random
- The total number of atoms decreases
- Vacancy locations are implicit in the resulting structure
- Defect concentration controls the fraction of removed atoms

This model is suitable for studying vacancy formation and concentration-dependent effects in silicon slabs.

---

### Frenkel Defects

Frenkel defects are modeled as vacancy–interstitial pairs.

**Implementation details:**
- Selected atoms are displaced from lattice sites
- Displaced atoms are relocated to randomly sampled interstitial positions
- The total number of atoms remains constant
- Minimum distance constraints prevent unphysical atomic overlap

This approach enables the study of lattice disorder and interstitial dynamics while preserving system stoichiometry.

## Machine Learning Integration (In Progress)

Machine learning integration is currently under development. Planned features include:

- Automatic labeling of structures with defect and dopant metadata
- Dataset export pipelines for ML interatomic potentials
- Feature extraction and descriptor generation
- Integration with supervised and reinforcement learning workflows for materials discovery

This component will leverage the large, reproducible structure ensembles generated by the `Structures` and `Defects` classes to enable data-driven modeling and accelerated materials exploration.

# MLMD-ReaxFF: Accelerated Reactive MD for Si/Ag with Defects

Machine Learning–accelerated Reactive Molecular Dynamics (MLMD) framework for Silicon wafers doped with Silver (Ag), including Schottky and Frenkel defect evolution under an NVT temperature schedule.

This system replaces expensive long-timescale ReaxFF RMD trajectories with learned recurrent models that approximate:

- Structure minimization
- NVT thermal evolution
- Potential energy trajectory
- Defect evolution over time

---

# Problem Setting

We model:

• Silicon wafer
• Ag dopant atoms
• Schottky defects
• Frenkel defects
• NVT temperature schedule

Traditional ReaxFF RMD is expensive due to:

- Small timestep requirements
- Charge equilibration
- Long trajectory lengths
- Multiple temperature ramps

This project builds two RNN-based models to approximate that process.
