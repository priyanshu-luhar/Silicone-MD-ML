## Introduction

Silicone-MD-ML is a modular Python framework for generating large ensembles of atomistic silicon slab structures with controlled chemical doping and point defects. The primary goal of this project is to support high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the construction of statistically meaningful datasets for data-driven and machine-learning-based materials modeling.

The framework emphasizes reproducibility, physical interpretability, and scalability. All stochastic operations are explicitly controlled, allowing deterministic regeneration of identical structures across different runs and systems.

## Structures Class

The `Structures` class is responsible for handling pristine silicon slabs and generating substitutionally doped variants.

### Purpose

- Load and validate XYZ-formatted atomic structures
- Perform uniform random substitutional doping
- Track structure identities across large generation campaigns
- Output doped structures in XYZ format with descriptive metadata

### Doping Model

Substitutional doping is implemented by uniformly sampling silicon atoms and replacing their atomic species with a specified dopant element. Atomic coordinates remain unchanged, ensuring that only chemical identity is modified. The number of substitutions is determined by the requested dopant concentration.

Both fractional (e.g., `0.001`) and percentage (e.g., `0.1`) concentrations are supported. Random sampling can be seeded to guarantee reproducibility.

### Design Features

- Uniform random selection without replacement
- Deterministic behavior through explicit seeding
- Automatic structure ID incrementation
- Clean separation between structure loading and modification logic

## Defects Class

The `Defects` class introduces point defects into previously generated (pristine or doped) structures.

### Purpose

- Apply physically motivated point defects to atomistic structures
- Support both vacancy-based and displacement-based defect models
- Maintain reproducibility and uniform defect distributions

---

### Schottky Defects

Schottky defects are modeled as vacancies created by removing atoms from their lattice sites.

**Implementation details:**
- Atoms are removed uniformly at random
- The total number of atoms decreases
- Vacancy locations are implicit in the resulting structure
- Defect concentration controls the fraction of removed atoms

This model is suitable for studying vacancy formation and concentration-dependent effects in silicon slabs.

### Frenkel Defects

Frenkel defects are modeled as vacancy–interstitial pairs.

**Implementation details:**
- Selected atoms are displaced from lattice sites
- Displaced atoms are relocated to randomly sampled interstitial positions
- The total number of atoms remains constant
- Minimum distance constraints prevent unphysical atomic overlap

This approach enables the study of lattice disorder and interstitial dynamics while preserving system stoichiometry.

## Machine Learning Integration (In Progress)

Machine learning integration is currently under development. Planned features include:

- Automatic labeling of structures with defect and dopant metadata
- Dataset export pipelines for ML interatomic potentials
- Feature extraction and descriptor generation
- Integration with supervised and reinforcement learning workflows for materials discovery

This component will leverage the large, reproducible structure ensembles generated by the `Structures` and `Defects` classes to enable data-driven modeling and accelerated materials exploration.

## Status

Active development. Structure generation and defect modeling are complete; machine learning components are in progress.
